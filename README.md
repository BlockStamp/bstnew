Bst is a new digital currency intended to store user data in blockchain. 
It is based on Bitcon peer-to-peer technolgy to operate with no central authority.
To distinguish from Bitcoin, Bst uses hashes of blocks begining with the most significant bit set to one (0x80000000.... instead of 0x00000000...).

To start using Bst you shoud build the project and run a node. The node default configuration contains build in addresses that let you
connect to our working nodes. When you connect them, your node should start downloading blocks.
After downloading process is done you can start working with Bst.

Default settings for Bst are following: 
working directory:		~/.bst 
config file:			bst.conf
RPC port:			8445
peer-to-peer network port:	8446
executable names:		bst*

To store and retrieve data from the Bst blockchain RPC bitcoin commands should be used.
Bst project is under development and new features are continously added. Especially new RPC commands facilitating
data manipulation are going to be provided.
